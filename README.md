Heya!<br>
The name be Noctis (or Noc for short). Most know me as Noctis Ōkami.<br>
I'm 20, a femboy, and taken by my bf, Ash. I'm actually male, but I'm fine with "she/her" pronouns. Either works though, as I won't yell at you for getting it wrong.<br>
<br>
I've been in the furry fandom for more than 7 years.<br>
I'm more into the artistic side. Majority of my art is furry related (obviously), but at rare occurrence I could do icons and banners for others.<br>
On the programming side, I develop Discord bots with Python as my programming language. As for my sona, I'm just your friendly wolf who tends to be shy most of the time and loves being feminine.<br>
